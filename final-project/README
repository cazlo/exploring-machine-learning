   python libraries sklearn and numpy (on debian-like OSes: 'sudo apt-get install python-sklearn python-numpy' See google for instructions for getting these libraries on other OSes)

RUNNING:
   python main.py <path/to/train.txt> <path/to/prelim-labeled.txt> <path/to/final-unlabled.txt>

	where train.txt is the original labeled training file
              prelim-labeled.txt is the labeled version of the test file used in the preliminary evaluation
              final-unlabled.txt is the final unlabeled data to classify

WHAT THIS PROGRAM DOES:
   uses sklearn library classifiers for feature selection and classification
   outputs 3 output files predicted from the 3 best classifiers in the system
